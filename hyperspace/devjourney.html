									<h2>Intention</h2>
									<p>I developed this demo to demo-n-strate my Unreal Engine capabilities. While I have ensured the basic features of a simple 3rd-person melee combat game is to be executed well, 
										I brought on more focus to <strong>sequences and animation</strong>, as I believed cinematics is my thing and is fun to do.</p>
									<p>This project was actually started in Unreal Enigne 4.6. When I picked it up again in Oct 2022, I successfully converted it to Unreal Engine 5.0. 
										At that point, the only features present was sword collision on enemies only and basic AI navigation.</p>

									<h2>Goal</h2>
									<p>I was browsing through all the assets that came with the Paragon Aurora pack and there were really interesting and wonderful materials, animation and special effects.
										 So I picked up the project again with a goal in mind - to develop as many features as I can within a self-stipulated time, so I can use most, if not all, of the animation and special effects present. 
										 This turned out to be more of a Paragon Hero appreciation demo. :)</p>

									<h2>But Why Aurora?</h2>
									<p>I came across this Hero character in the UE Marketplace and know for certain I would want to showcase my Unreal capabilities with her.
										Also, I like all things Aurora, the magical waves in the sky of Iceland, the beloved Norwegian singer, sleeping...</p>

							<h2>Level Creation</h2>
							<p>The level was created with assets from the Paragon Props pack in the UE Marketplace. It is heavily inspired by the Bridge sub-level in Niflheim from God of War (2018) and its sequel.</p>

							<h2>Combat and Gameplay Features</h2>
							<p>I wanted to showcase a simple melee combat system with 2 abilities. So the demo has only melee-type enemies.
								In the conception of the project, I wanted to add a ranged enemy type but discarded that as I wanted to finish my project within the time I stipulated.
								I will create this in my next project, hopefully.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Aurora</h3>
									<p><ul>
										<li>Aurora has combo attacks, which consists of 3 animation. They came pre-configured in Blueprint but I converted them to C++, because I wanted to add more stuff to it.</li>
										<li>Aurora has 2 abilties. Each ability call consumes a certain amount of Energy from her Energy pool, which is represented by the yellow bar at the top of the screen.</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
											<li>Notice that this bar is separated into 2 parts (there is a gap).</li>
											<li>If Aurora's Energy pool is completely depleted after an ability call, she will go into the Exhausted state, in which she will not be able to move, and becomes vulnerable to attacks.</li>
											<li>During the time she is in the Exhausted state, she will be recovering Energy (the only function that uses her own Actor Tick). The Energy bar will slowly replenish by itself over a certain duration.</li>
											<li>After it fills up only the first portion of the bar, she will recover, be able to move and stops replenishing.</li>
											<li>The Aurora character class has Energy states, that determines her animation and controls.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Aurora can pick up Health or Energy fragments, spawned from defeated enemies, to replenish her Health and Energy.</li>
									</ul></p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Melee Enemies</h3>
									<p><ul>
										<li>Hitting an enemy will cancel any attack animation it is currently playing. However, this does not apply to the Aurora character. 
											<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
												<li>I pulled out the Interrupted pin off the animation node to finish its BT Task, leaving it to <strong>immediately</strong> play the Hit React animation.</li>
												<li>Not to self-sabotage myself but it's better to be honest here - how this worked was kind of an accident and this is only my theory. But I promise to do more experimentation on this.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Enemy should have a small delay between attacks.
											<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>They were chaotically dangerous without it. Their attack animations are pretty fast compared to Aurora's default one.</li></ul>
										</li>
										<li>Enemies have a limited sight detection range. If they do not see Aurora within a certain radius (currently set at 500m), they will wander about. This is controlled in its AI Behavior Tree.</li>
										<li>Each melee enemy has 2 swords. There are a few attack animation for the melee enemy. It can swing one sword, either from its left or right arm, or both swords at the same time. Which animation to play is random.</li>
										<li>All melee enemies (not the End Game Boss though) will enter Stun state whenever they are hit by any of Aurora's abilities. Melee enemies have movement states that determine the animation and AI Behavior.</li>
										<li>There are 2 melee enemy variation. The stronger one (which can only be spawned at the upper part of the level) was a child of the base Melee Enemy class.</li>
									</ul></p>

							<h2>Hit React Animation</h2>
							<p>Both Aurora and Melee Enemy characters will play an animation when they are hit, what animation to be played depends on the direction the hit came from.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Animation</h3>
									<p>Both Aurora and the Melee Enemy class have 4 hit react animation each, for when they are hit from the Front, Back and their sides.</p>

									<a href="images/HitReactSketch.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/HitReactSketch.jpg" alt=""/></a>
								</section>
								<section style="padding: 5em 1em 5em 1em;">
									<p> This is my sketch of the logic for knowing the direction. I've separated an actor's angle into 8 segments. 
									If the hit comes from the front, then it is Segments 1 & 8.</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li>FindLookAtRotation is the key function to use here. It gives you the rotation value of an actor from the owner.</li>
											<li>However, the angle needs to be recalculated in respect to the owner.</li>
											<li>The class requires at least 4 animation, otherwise the editor will display an error when it tries to play a Hit React animation upon being hit.</li>
										</ul>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3></h3>
									<p>However, to ensure that designers or integrators have assigned the correct number of animation in the Blueprint, I left a small note on the attribute in the Details panel.
										This was done with meta specifiers.

							<h2>Enemy Spawn Manager</h2>
							<p></p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Functionality</h3>
									<p><ul>
											<li>Each trigger of the Enemy Spawn Manager by Aurora will spawn <strong>waves</strong> of enemies. A new wave will begin after the last enemy in the current wave is defeated.</li>
											<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
												<li>The straight forward way to do this is to use "Get All Actors of Class" each time an enemy is killed to check if there are anymore enemies left in the level by comparing their numbers. 
													However, this will probably cause performance issues if let's say there are 100 enemies on the level!</li>
												<li>What I did was to create a delegate on the Enemy class and broadcast about its death to the Spawn Manager just before it is destroyed. 
													The Spawn Manager will do the comparing of numbers and determine if the current wave has indeed ended.</li>
											</ul>
												<li>The number of waves increases by 1 for every subsequent trigger, up to a specified maximum number. It starts with at least 2 waves.</li>
												<li>For each wave, a specified number of enemies will be spawned. Together with the number of waves, these numbers are adjustable in the actor's Details panel.</li>
												<li>Each enemy will spawn on scene with an interval in between spawns.</li>
										</ul>

									Details panel - Enemy Spawn Manager variables.
								</section>
								<section style="padding: 5em 1em 5em 1em;">
									<ul>
										<li>Whenever a new wave starts, an environment event sequence is played. This includes the increasing (and then decreasing) of the rotational speed of various revolving actors in the level. 
											They are communicated to the manager via the use of Event Dispatchers in Blueprint instead.</li>
										<li>Giving player time to breath, they have to wait for a short duration, determined by the Trigger Interval, before she can trigger the next group of waves. 
											This, and many other time-based functions in this project, are handled by the World Timer Manager with timer handles in C++.</li>
