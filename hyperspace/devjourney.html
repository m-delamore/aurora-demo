									<h2>Intention</h2>
									<p>I developed this demo to demo-n-strate my Unreal capabilities. While I have ensured the basic features of a simple 3rd-person melee combat game is to be executed well, 
										I brought on more focus to <strong>sequences and animation</strong>, as I believed cinematics is my thing and is fun to do.</p>
									<p>This project was actually started in Unreal Enigne 4. When I picked it up again in Oct 2022, I successfully converted it to Unreal Engine 5.0</p>

									<h2>Why Aurora</h2>
									<p>I came across this Hero character in the UE Marketplace and know for certain I would want to showcase my Unreal capabilities with her.
										Also, I like all things Aurora, the magical waves in the sky of Iceland, the beloved Norwegian singer, sleeping...</p>

							<h2>Level Creation</h2>
							<p>The level was created with assets from the Paragon Props pack in the UE Marketplace. It is heavily inspired by the Bridge sub-level in Niflheim from God of War (2018) and its sequel.</p>

									<p>Completed static assets placement of the level. No blocking was initially done prior to this.</p>

									<h3>Custom Meshes</h3>
									<p>There were a few tiling meshes in the level which I created from scratch using Maya 2020.
										<ul>
											<li>Stair Trims</li>
											<li>Statue Base Trims</li>
											<li>Mid Bridge Structure</li>

							<h2>Combat and Gameplay Features</h2>
							<p>I wanted to showcase a simple melee combat system with 2 abilities. So the demo has only melee-type enemies.
								In the conception of the project, I wanted to add a ranged enemy type but discarded that as I wanted to finish my project within the time I stipulated.
								I will create this in my next project, hopefully.</p>

									<h3>Aurora</h3>
									<p><ul>
										<li>Aurora has combo attacks, which consists of 3 animation. They came pre-configured in Blueprint but I converted them to C++, because I wanted to add more stuff to it.</li>
										<li>Aurora has 2 abilties. Each ability call consumes a certain amount of Energy from her Energy pool, which is represented by the yellow bar at the top of the screen.</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Notice that this bar is separated into 2 parts (there is a gap).</li>
											<li>If Aurora's Energy pool is completely depleted after an ability call, she will go into the Exhausted state, in which she will not be able to move, and becomes vulnerable to attacks.</li>
											<li>During the time she is in the Exhausted state, she will be recovering Energy (the only function that uses her own Actor Tick). The Energy bar will slowly replenish by itself over a certain duration.</li>
											<li>After it fills up only the first portion of the bar, she will recover, be able to move and stops replenishing.</li>
											<li>The Aurora character class has Energy states, that determines her animation and controls.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Aurora can pick up Health or Energy fragments, spawned from defeated enemies, to replenish her Health and Energy.</li>
									</ul></p>
								</section>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Melee Enemies</h3>
									<p><ul>
										<li>Hitting an enemy will cancel any attack animation it is currently playing. However, this does not apply to the Aurora character. 
											<ul>
												<li>I pulled out the Interrupted pin off the animation node to finish its BT Task, leaving it to <strong>immediately</strong> play the Hit React animation.</li>
												<li>Not to self-sabotage myself but it's better to be honest here - how this worked was kind of an accident and this is only my theory. But I promise to do more experimentation on this.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Enemy should have a small delay between attacks.
											<ul><li>They were chaotically dangerous without it. Their attack animations are pretty fast compared to Aurora's default one.</li></ul>
										</li>
										<li>Enemies have a limited sight detection range. If they do not see Aurora within a certain radius (currently set at 500m), they will wander about. This is controlled in its AI Behavior Tree.</li>
										<li>Each melee enemy has 2 swords. There are a few attack animation for the melee enemy. It can swing one sword, either from its left or right arm, or both swords at the same time. Which animation to play is random.</li>
										<li>All melee enemies (not the End Game Boss though) will enter Stun state whenever they are hit by any of Aurora's abilities. Melee enemies have movement states that determine the animation and AI Behavior.</li>
										<li>There are 2 melee enemy variation. The stronger one (which can only be spawned at the upper part of the level) was a child of the base Melee Enemy class.</li>
									</ul></p>
