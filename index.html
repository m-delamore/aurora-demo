							<p>The main character Aurora is from an existing game called Paragon (which I have never played before and still do not know what it is). Her character assets can be downloaded for free from the UE Marketplace.</p>
							<p>
								<h4>What is this demo about?</h4>
								<li>A simple 3rd person melee combat game that has a beginning, mid and end, on a very small scale.</li>
								<li>This demo is developed with C++ and Blueprint. Gameplay functionalities are mostly C++. Cinematic and cosmetic ones are mostly Blueprint.</li>
								<li><strong>No gameplay system or functionality packs were used at all!</strong> Only asset packs.</li>
								<li>It will probably take about more or less 20 minutes to complete the demo, unless you're a game tester and spends time to try to break the game.</li>
								<li>On that note, I tried my very best for it to be free of bugs. There are a few bugs in the game, but I considered them to be a low P5 issue > Backlog > Forever.</li>
								<li>Apologies in advance if you do encounter soft-locks or crashes. This small demo was not thoroughly tested. Do message me if you encounter one.</li>
								<li>Game balance favors the player to be able to complete the game with at most three deaths. This means... it's not tweaked, while also not intended, for a "balanced" experience.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Software Tools used</h4>
								<li>Unreal Engine 5.0</li>
								<li>Visual Studio 2022</li>
								<li>Sourcetree (using Bitbucket)</li>
								<li>Trello - Definitely need this even for small demo.</li>
								<li>Maya 2020 (Student version)</li>
								<li>PhotoPea - Online Photo Editor (I highly recommend this! It's basically like Photoshop, and it's friggin' free!)</li>
								<li>Sound Forge Audio Studio</li>

							<h3 style="text-align: center">Known Issues</h3>
							<p>
							<h4>AUR-001 | Super short duration of the start-up logo animation and loading screen.</h4>
									<li>This also means you have a fast computer. Congrats! :P </li>
									<li>It was a simple setup with Async Loading Screen plugin. I had only solved the issue with the background asset not loading in it by pre-loading it in Blueprint. I would have used the Manual Stop option to be able to control the timing but that would be a Backlog for my Unreal engine experience.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
							<h4>AUR-002 | There is a small chance enemies will wander into an area with a barrier and then not able to get out.</h4>
									<li>Considered a P5 priority because that enemy can still be killed as it will eventually run toward Aurora where her sword can still reach it. </li>
							</p>
							<p>
							<h4>AUR-003 | Enemies turn towards Aurora in an instant.</h4>
									<li>So... there was no turn rate logic applied to the Move To function.</li>
									<li>Had known this at the beginning of the project. I did not put it to task in Trello. Only realized this after packaging. That's the story.</li>
									<li>Will I fix this? Nah. For this small demo, it's fine.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
							<h4>AUR-004 | Frame rate drop upon Aurora's Death</h4>
								<li>This is due to the special effects activated upon that event. I used the effects provided from the UE Aurora pack, which consists of Cascade particles, which are known to take up significant GPU resources.</li>
								<li>You would also noticed there is frame rate drop whenever the camera faces the fire pits (higher elevation).</li>
								<li>Surprisingly, the fire effect was provided with the Starter Content pack... and it's also a Cascade system.</li>
								<li>Why didn't I convert them to the Niagara system instead? Little experience on Niagara + need to find Unreal developer job asap = no time</li>
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section class="spot">
						<div class="content">
							<h3 style="text-align: center">Features taken off due to reduced scope.</h3>
							<p>
								<h4>IK Leg</h4>
								<li>There was a Marketplace pack for this but it was too expansive (includes slope and animation warping) and there were too many variables involved. Integrating it will need more testing of all the animation, thus taking up more time. It does not support UE 5.0 anyways.
								<li>Will I implement? Probably. Will create a much more simpler one perhaps.</li>
								</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Save System</h4>
								<li>The save system came to mind towards the end of the project. And I really wanted to do this but...
								<li>Aurora's death count is tied, one-way, to a persistent actor which does not have states set up. This causes complications and I do not want to break the game at this point.</li>
								<li>Will I implement? Yes soon-ish.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Secret Achievements</h4>
								<li>What is it? I can't tell you. They are secret achievements.</li>
								<li>Why? Reduced scope.</li>
								<li>Will I implement? This will make the demo even more intersting. I see how life goes on for me.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Shooting Stars and a Galaxy based on particles.</h4>
								<li>This is just to add glitter to an already good-looking demo. P10!</li>
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section class="spot">
						<div class="content">
							<h3 style="text-align: center">Features intended but abandoned.</h3>
							<p>
								<h4>Auto-Target System</h4>
								<li>Decided not to implement towards the end of the project. But will do this in my next Unreal project.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Ranged Enemy</h4>
								<li>The AI Behaviour is gonna kill me. Nuff said.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Evil Twin of Aurora as the Final Boss</h4>
								<li>This will take another 3 months... unpaid.</li>
								<li>Also, AI Behaviour.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>To use the Ability System</h4>
								<li>This was what put me off when I started this project 2 years ago.</li>
								<li>I still have to learn it.</li>
								<li>Will I implement? In the next project on an even smaller, more manageable scale.</li>
